The Database is called Lokaverkefni and it is used in both our PHP website and C# group assignments.
The Database has 5 tables which all properly refrence each other. 
The only way to insert anything into the database is to go the 188.166.169.15/phpmyadmin or use the C# project we made.
Through the C# program we have a sign up form where you can create an User account.
There you can only select your age and nationality from a list not freely insert anything.

you can see the database in action http://188.166.169.15 <---- Here.

The connections between the tables are like this.
Company - Employee - Games - Scores - Users

We also made an ER map and exported the database which you can approach on our Github account.
